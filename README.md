## Description

The co-expression networks for different tissues were uniformly processed by the MEGENA pipeline. The gene expressions were generated from the normalized microarray datasets from different resources. 

For each tissue, four files were shared for the network results.

{Population}_{tissue}_network.tsv: The MEGENA co-expression network for each tissue.

{Population}_{tissue}_bigtable.tsv: The module summary information for the co-expression network.

{Population}_{tissue}_module.tsv: The module genes for the co-expression network.

{Population}_{tissue}_Bayesian.tsv: The Bayesian network for each tissue.
